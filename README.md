## Features

This is a multi-page website. You can navigate to different pages using the navigation bar at the top. Clicking at the logo at the navigation bar directs back to the home page if it's not clear.

## Responsive Design

The site works well with different window sizes and different mobile devices. It adapts according to the orientation of the device.  
There is also a scroll button on most of the pages to scroll to the main content.  
  
As I stated in the footer, this is not a real restaurant website, it's just a project. Also, the logos don't belong to me. The logos belong to the restaurant called "The Original".
